## Intro to Markdown

Markdown allows you to do things like **bold**, *italic*, and more!

Make a list with asterisks like: 
\* bold with double-asterisks
\* italics with underscores
\* code-type fond with backticks

You can also use hyphens instead of asterisks.

For a numbere list: 
1. bold.... 
1. italic.... 
1. code....
